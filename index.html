        I'm working on something truly awesome. Meanwhile...

        <p>
        The most popular molecular docking program – used by scientists looking for new drugs to treat various diseases: from cancer and diabetes to cardiovascular and infectious diseases.
        It predicts how a drug-like molecule would bind to its target.
        <p>
        It is now the most cited docking program, with
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4BD7MkgAAAAJ">30,000 citations</a>.
        This is comparable to the citations the
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=6286436358625670901&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en">AlphaFold</a> and the

        <p>
        I built this program in
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923233806/http://mgldev.scripps.edu/pipermail/autodock/2008-July/004312.html">1.5 years</a>, and it was 60x faster, while being more
        accurate than my employer’s previous creation.
        The 
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200101212816/http://vina.scripps.edu/">archive of the original site</a>
        has the details.
        (May take a while to load the images.)

        <p>The approach used machine learning: Training its "energy" function involved bi-level optimization, like meta-learning.

        A computer vision model for airport security scanners (the ones you go through before boarding a flight).

        This was part of the AI competition with the largest single prize pool ever: $1,500,000, so many teams put in a lot of effort.
        I was one of the 8 winners, placing 5th out of the 518 stage-1 teams (99th percentile).

        <p>

        The DHS mentions me in their news release:

        <p>

        Possibly the cleverest thing I've done: I discovered how to quickly get perfect scores during "normal" AI competitions.
        Previous perfect scores there were seen only in some very unusual circumstances.

        <p>

        At first, people thought this was a computer hack, bug, or data leak. But it was an algorithmic trick:

        Later, another researcher (formerly at Harvard) independently came up with his own (rather complex) approach,
        but could only learn 5.2 labels per submission, compared to my 15:
